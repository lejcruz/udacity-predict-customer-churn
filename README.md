# udacity-predict-customer-churn

## Project Introduction

In this project, you will implement your learnings to identify credit card customers who are most likely to churn. The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package can also be run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

This project will give you practice using your skills for testing and logging and using the best coding practices from this lesson. It will also introduce you to a problem data scientists across companies always face. How do we identify (and later intervene with) customers likely to churn?

If you want to download the data and work locally with the data, start the Workspace and download the data from the data folder. This ensures all students have access to the dataset. Below, you have a sample of the dataset:

Note: This project provides all students with a Workspace with all the requirements to develop and run their project. If you want to run it locally, you can download all the files and use your own setup to develop the project.
